    <p class="text-justify">The aim of this web service is to provide you a methodological approach to learn the principles of REST.
        The focus is not on explaining the theoretical concepts of REST but actually interacting with a RESTful service as a client.
    Hence, it would be useful if you have some idea of REST beforehand.
        <br><br>

<div class="container content-container bg-white">
    <p class="text-justify">
        Assuming that we have got some knowledge of REST now, let us just quickly brush-up some concepts in a simple way.</p>
</div>

<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">What is REST ?</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">REST is an architectural style to design an interface for client-server communication.</p>
</div>

<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">Core Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">There are two core guidelines behind RESTful thinking.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        1. Design APIs around resources
        <br>
        2. Provide links to navigate the service
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">Please note that here, we are not talking about the six constraints of REST as defined by Roy Fielding.
        We are focusing on the intent behind REST style.</p>
</div>


<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">What does "REST" mean?</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">We know that REST stands for <b class="imp-term">REpresentational State Transfer</b> but what does that really mean ?</p>
    <p class="text-justify">It simply means that the server transfers a representation of the state of a resource to the client.</p>
</div>

<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">REST != HTTP</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">Learn this by heart! REST does not necessarily mean APIs over HTTP. Its just that it is easier to implement REST style with HTTP.</p>
</div>

<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">Measuring RESTfulness</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">Leonard Richardson has created one model, named as Richardson Maturity Model (RMM), to measure the RESTfulness of a service.
        This model has defined four levels of RESTfulness, from level 0 to level 3. Level 3 meaning the highest level of RESTfulness.
        <br>One important thing to note here is that this model works for only those services which are using HTTP for communication.</p>
</div>

<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">RMM Levels</h3>
    <p>To learn about the levels of RMM model, you can read the article :
        <a href="https://restfulapi.net/richardson-maturity-model/" target="_blank">Richardson Maturity Model</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Below is the summarized version of the levels as defined by RMM.</p>
    <p>Level 0 - Single URI over HTTP</p>
    <p>Level 1 - Resource URIs</p>
    <p>Level 2 - Resource URIs + HTTP verbs</p>
    <p>Level 3 - Resource URIs + HTTP verbs + Hypermedia</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-justify">Please note that level 3 (highest level) of RMM talks about the use of hypermedia
        however it actually is one of the core guidelines of REST i.e usage of hypermedia is a <b class="imp-term">pre-condition</b> to REST.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        RMM might not be the best model to measure the RESTfulness
        but it surely is a good model to understand the concepts behind REST in a progressive manner.
        Keeping that in mind, this service exposes APIs according to each level of the RMM model.
        <br><br>
        Let us now start with our objective of this article i.e explore an example which would help us learn REST in a practical way.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">Introduction to our Example Service</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
        This web service on which you are reading this article, has exposed some APIs over HTTP.
        <br><br>
        It contains two resources:<br>
        1. Employee<br>
        2. Order
        <br><br>
        We can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on these two resources through the exposed APIs.
        We will use Employee resource for exploring about the first 3 levels i.e level 0 to level 2 and
        both the resources for the last level i.e level 3.
        <br><br>
        This service uses Swagger for documenting the exposed APIs.
        Please click the button below to go to the API documentation.
        The APIs are categorized according to the resource and the RMM level.

    </p>
    <br>
    <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg justify-center" href="/swagger-ui.html" role="button">Explore Swagger API Documentation</a>
    <br><br>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Next, we would see how these APIs are becoming more and more RESTful as we gradually proceed to higher levels.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container content-container-alert bg-white">
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <p class="text-justify mid-notices">This example is inspired from the spring.io article : <a href="https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/">Building REST services with Spring</a> </p>
    </div>
</div>


<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">Level 0 APIs</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Level 0 states that a single URI would be exposed via HTTP.
        Because the URI is same, we need to send all the information (i.e action and data) in the payload of the URI.
        In our example, we have exposed a single endpoint <i>/employeeService</i>
        and we send the action and the required data in the payload of the HTTP request.
        <br><br>
        The available actions are : <br>
        1. <i>create</i> for creating a employee<br>
        2. <i>readAll</i> for retrieving all the employees<br>
        3. <i>read</i> for retrieving one employee given the employee id in the payload<br>
        4. <i>update</i> for updating an employee<br>
        5. <i>delete</i> for deleting an employee<br>
        <br>
        Checkout the Level 0 APIs in the swagger documentation for further API details.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">Level 1 APIs</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Level 1 states that the service should have URIs according to the resources in the system.
        Here, we have designed our API denoting the resource i.e <i>/employee</i> (unlike <i>/employeeService</i>)
        with different endpoints for different actions of the resource.
        We have added the action name to the endpoint <i>/employee</i>,
        hence, we only need to send the required data in the payload of the HTTP request of that particular action.
        <br><br>
        Checkout the Level 1 APIs in the swagger documentation for further API details.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">Level 2 APIs</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Level 2 states that the service should have URIs according to the resources in the system
        and in addition to that it should be utilising HTTP verbs for denoting the corresponding actions on that resource.
        <br>
        For example, use HTTP GET for reading the data, HTTP POST for creating new data, etc.
        Here, we have designed our API denoting the resource i.e <i>/employee</i>
        with different endpoints using appropriate HTTP verb for the actions of the resource.
        Here, we don't need to add any action name to the /employee endpoint as we are utilising HTTP verbs for that.
        <br><br>
        Checkout the Level 2 APIs in the swagger documentation for further API details.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container content-container bg-white ">
    <h3 class="margin">Level 3 APIs</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Level 3 states that the service should be following all the requirements of level 2 and in addition to that,
        it should provide hypermedia in the API response using which the client can navigate the service further.
        This is termed as HATEOAS (read more <a href="https://restfulapi.net/hateoas/">here</a>) and is one of the core requirements for a RESTful service.
        <br><br>
        HATEOAS simply says that if you are providing some resource state to a client, then you need to also provide some
        additional links which should tell the client how to perform other valid actions related to that resource.
        <br><br>
        In our example, we have two resources to demonstrate the HATEOAS feature.
        <br><br>
        First, let us go through the Employee resource. If we try to do any operation on the employee resource, we would see
        a more heavy response containing some additional links.
        For example, reading one employee would also provide us a link to read all the employees.
        <br><br>
        Now, coming to the second resource i.e Order. Order resource has a property called State.
        Every order would be having any one state out of these three states : IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED and CANCELLED.
        <br>
        -> The order with IN_PROGRESS state can either be cancelled or completed i.e can either go to CANCELLED or COMPLETED state.
        <br>
        -> The order with CANCELLED or COMPLETED state cannot go to any other state.
        <br><br>
        Check out the read API call response for an order with IN_PROGRESS state. We find that we get some links in the response.
        We would be getting 4 links in the response out of which two links give us the two valid action URIs which we can perform on this particular order.
        However, if we try out the read API call for an order with CANCELLED or COMPLETED state, we won't get any links for cancel and complete action.
        This variation in response tells the client about the valid actions that can be performed on a particular order resource.
        <br><br>
        One important thing to note here is that due to the above feature, client does not need to store server-side logic of invalid or valid actions.
        It depends on the response given by the server. For example, in future, if server decides to allow completion of a cancelled order,
        then the client does not have to change anything on its side as everything would be handled dynamically whenever the response changes from the server,
        provided the client has written its logic in such a way.
